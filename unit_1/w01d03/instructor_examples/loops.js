// FOR LOOPS

// Looping with i
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    // Although you can call a loop variable whatever you like, Standard Industry Practice is to use i, so that's what we recommend! (i --> aka the ITERATOR variable)
    console.log(i)
}

// Looping 
for (let station = 0; station < 10; station++) {
    console.log(station)
    console.log('All aboard for the next station!')
}

for (let step = 0; step < 1000; step++) {
    console.log(step)
    console.log('Keep walking')
}

// SUM OF EVEN INTEGERS BETWEEN 0 AND 10
    // That thing about even numbers...
    // Start at 0, End at 10
    let evenSum = 0
    let rando = 20
    for (let i = 0; i <=10; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            
            console.log(rando += i)
        }
    }

    // evenSum += i is the exact same thing as evenSum = evenSum + i***
