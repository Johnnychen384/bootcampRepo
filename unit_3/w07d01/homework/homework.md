# Let's learn about SPA!

What is a Single-Page Application (SPA)? A single-page application is an app that works inside a browser and does not require page reloading during use. This gets rid of the wait time from loading new pages.

What is a Multi-Page Application (MPA)? An app that with every change renders a new page into the browser.


When we built our Unit 2 apps, were they a SPA or MPA, why? Our apps were built in MPA bceause with when we wanted to view new data it required us to send that data into a new page and render that page rather than just shift the content for the specific section of the page.


Give two pros of a SPA

2. backend code can be reused for mobile and desktop.


Give two cons of a SPA
1. SEO is more difficult because its content is loaded by AJAX.
2. Memory leaks can cause system to slowdown.


Give two pros of a MPA
1. Easy SEO management.
2. Provides clear visual map for where to go in the app.

Give two cons of a MPA
1. Longer development process.
2. Frontend and backend development are tightly coupled.


# Let's refresh our memory on API's

What were the three great technical accomplishments of MPL? 
1. It served as a crack team which understood the infrastructure of the site and could resolve small issues as they arose
2. They built an app called App2 which is an insurance app that signed up users in half the time of the original app.
3. It also was less expensive and fully functional with no crashing.

What does 'API' stand for? * Application programming interfaces.

What is an API? * An intermediary that allows 2 applications to talk to each other.
